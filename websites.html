                    <p>
                        There’s beauty in diversity. So, Nykaa shelved the 
                        one-size-fits-all approach in favour of one that 
                        celebrates differences, of every kind. Whatever 
                        her style, size, or spending power, Nykaa wants each 
                        woman who shops with it to feel welcome, inspired 
                        and excited. This is reflected in the very varied 
                        mix of over 500 labels and 75,000 styles that make 
                        up Nykaa Fashion today. Here, you can see lesser-known, 
                        luxe and high-street names sit together in harmony.
